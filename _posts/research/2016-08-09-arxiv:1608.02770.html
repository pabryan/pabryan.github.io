We study long-time existence and asymptotic behaviour for a class of anisotropic, expanding curvature flows. For this we adapt new curvature estimates, which were developed by Guan, Ren and Wang to treat some stationary prescribed curvature problems. As an application we give a unified flow approach to the existence of smooth, even \(L_p\)-Minkowski problems in \(\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\) for \(p>−n−1\).
