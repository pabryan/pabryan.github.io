abstract: Glen Wheeler discusses non-negative ancient solutions to the heat equation on Euclidean space. He works through the representation theorem of Lin and Zhang for such solutions, which expresses the solution pointwise as integrals of Borel measures in a specific form. This is used later in part 2 to bound the dimension of the space of ancient solutions with a specific (polynomial) growth rate and obtain a beautiful decomposition into a polynomial in time with coefficients given by functions polyharmonic in space.
