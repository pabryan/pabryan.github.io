<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Status: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mathematics: Complete.
</li>
<li>Writing: Almost complete. needs an introduction and tidy up of the convergence argument.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Summary: 
This paper extends the ideas in my <a href="#sec-2-2">previous paper</a> with Ben Andrews from Ricci flow on the 2-sphere to arbitrary surfaces. I also delve a little more deeply into the isoperimetric profile on surfaces, investigating the connection between curvature and the concavity of the isoperimetric profile along with deriving viscosity equations for the isoperimetric profile.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Status: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mathematics: Almost complete. Needs some details sorted out. The main outstanding item is finding suitable comparisons (we have some restricted cases).
</li>
<li>Writing: Almost complete, modulo the comparisons.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Summary: 
We introduce the chord/arc-profile and derive viscosity equations for it. Then we may apply comparisons to obtain convergence results. The essential technique is contained in this <a href="#sec-2-3">paper</a> above. We need to make a novel application of spectral theory to couple the time variation of the chord/arc-profile with the spatial viscosity equation and the construction of comparison functions is more complicated.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Status: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mathematics: Essentially complete, up to dotting the I's and crossing the T's in our calculations. 
</li>
<li>Writing: The outline is mostly written, but needs to be compiled into a cohesive whole.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Summary: We prove that the only ancient solutions to the curve shortening flow on the 2-sphere are families of shrinking geodesic circles. An application of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem allows us to show that ancient solutions must have backwards limit an equator. An Alexandrov reflection argument then completes the proof.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Status: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mathematics: The theory is complete. I haven't considered the computational modelling side of things here, though it should be a straightforward application of existing methods.
</li>
<li>Writing: It is mostly complete. I need to decide how general to be, which is causing me some conflict at present.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Summary: The original motivation was inspired by <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2081">A mathematical model for unsteady mixed flows in closed water pipes</a> and my work with Steve Roberts on <a href="http://anuga.anu.edu.au/">ANUGA</a>. I prefer a more geometric approach and so have phrased the problem in terms of Riemannian geometry which avoids some of the difficulties faced by taking a pre-manifold type approach. The results here are essentially the same, and should be taken in the spirit of "Hughes, T., Lubliner, J., 1973. On the one-dimensional theory of blood flow in the large vessels. Mathematical Biosciences 18, 161â€“170." who show that the derivation still works if one relaxes the requirement of uniform, circular cross sections. A particularly nice feature of my approach, is that after discretisation of the domain, there is no need to match boundary conditions which should result in a computationally more efficient method than some previous methods.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Status: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mathematics: The program is defined, we just need to check that it works.
</li>
<li>Writing: Nothing much yet.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Summary:
We are attempting to prove a Harnack inequality for hypersurface flows in hyperbolic space, particularly in three dimensions. The technique is inspired by <i>Harnack inequalities for evolving hypersurfaces</i> by Ben Andrews. Mathematische Zeitschrift September 1994, Volume 217, Issue 1, pp 179-197. We can define a support function for a hypersurface and transfer out study to the support function. The complications that arise are in dealing with the curvature terms and terms related to the distance function arising from the hyperbolic metric. We must also uniformly relate the Wulff shape of a hypersurface with the original hypersurface adding further complication to the method.

<h4 id="sec-3-1-7">A distance comparison theorem for networks evolving by curve shortening.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-7">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Status: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mathematics: I essentially have a comparison theorem. I'm a little unsure about the best formulation of the free-boundary problem. I also don't know what comparison to choose though I have a guiding idea.
</li>
<li>Writing: Only the basic variational argument is written so far.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Summary: The idea here is to investigate whether a distance comparison principle holds for networks as a model for other lower regularity problems. A comparison theorem in the spirit of Huisken has been obtained in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1108">Evolution of convex lens-shaped networks under curve shortening flow</a>. The idea here is to obtain stronger control via viscosity methods and comparison principles.
