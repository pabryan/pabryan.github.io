For the following applications it is sufficient to restrict to the case where \(A\) is self adjoint. Let's ju
st take a look at this condition. That is, an endomorphism \(T\) is self adjoint provided \(g(T(X), Y) = g(X, T(Y)\).
</p>

<p>
Given any arbitrary endomorphism \(T\), the adjoint \(T^{\ast}\) is defined by the relation
\[
g(T^{\ast} (X), Y) = g(X, T(Y)).
\]
The operator \(T\) is then self adjoint if and only if \(T = T^{\ast}\).
</p>

<p>
Equivalently, \(T^{\ast}\) is defined by metric contraction: let \(B(X, Y) = g(X, T(Y)) = \operatorname{Tr}_g^2 T\) where the \(2\) denotes the contraction is in the second slot of \(g\). Then \(T^{\ast} = \operatorname{Tr}_{g^{\ast}}^1 B\) where \(g^{\ast}\) denotes the dual metric. In other words, \(T^{\ast}\) is obtained by first metric lowering the upper index of \(T\) into the second slot and then metric-raising the first slot. Explicitly,
\[
T^{\ast} = \operatorname{Tr}^1 g^{\ast} \otimes \operatorname{Tr}^2 (g \otimes T).
\]
With respect to a frame,
\[
(T^{\ast})^i_j = g^{ik} g_{jl} T^l_k
\]
In particular, if \(T_t\) is a smooth one parameter family along \(\gamma\), since \(g\) is also smooth, then \(T^{\ast}_t\) is a smooth one-parameter family.

For any tangent vector \(Z\), the endomorphism \(\operatorname{R}_Z\) is \(g\)-self adjoint. That is for any vector fields \(X, Y\) along \(\gamma\),
\[
g(\operatorname{R}_Z (X), Y) = g(X, \operatorname{R}_Z(Y)).
\]
</p>

</div>

<div class="proof">
<p>
By the curvature tensor symmetries,
\[
g(\operatorname{R}_Z (X), Y) = \operatorname{Rm} (X, Z, Z, Y) = \operatorname{Rm} (Y, Z, Z, X) = g(X, \operatorname{R}_Z (Y))
\]
so that \(\operatorname{R}_Z\) is self adjoint.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Employing the Riccati equation and the self-adjointness of \(\operatorname{R}_V\) we may deduce necessary and sufficient conditions for when \(A(t)\) is self adjoint for each \(t\).
</p>

<div class="lem">
<p>
Let \(A(t)\) satisfy the Riccati equation. The \(A(t)\) is self adjoint for every \(t\) if and only if \(A(0)\) is self adjoint.
</p>

</div>

<div class="proof">
<p>
One implication is obvious: if \(A(t)\) is self adjoint for every \(t\), then certainly it is self adjoint for \(t = 0\).
</p>

<p>
Conversely, suppose that \(A(0)\) is self adjoint. Let \(A^{\ast}\) denote it's adjoint. That is \(A^{\ast}\) is defined by
\[
g(A^{\ast} (X), Y) = g(X, A(Y))
\]
and is differentiable with respect to \(t\). By assumption \(A^{\ast}(0) = A\) and we need to show that \(A^{\ast}(t) = A(t)\) for every \(t\).
</p>

<p>
Now, we determine \(A^{\ast} (t)\) and \(\partial_t A^{\ast} (t)\) by their action on tangent vectors at \(\gamma(t)\). In fact, we may do this by determining their action on parallel fields along \(\gamma\): Let \(X, Y\) be arbitrary parallel vector fields along \(\gamma\). Since parallel transport is an isomorphism, every tangent vector in \(T_{\gamma(t)} M\) is equal to the restriction \(X(t)\) of such a parallel field \(X\) along \(\gamma\). Thus we may compute the variation of \(A^{\ast}\) by differentiating the relation
\[
g(A^{\ast} (X), Y) = g(X, A(Y)).
\]
where \(X, Y\) and parallel vector fields. As usual, putting \(V = \gamma'\) then differentiating, using metric compatibility and the fact that \(X, Y\) are parallel gives
\[
g((\nabla_V A^{\ast}) (X), Y) = g(X, (\nabla_V A) (Y)).
\]
Note here that the parallel assumption gives \(\nabla_V X = \nabla_V Y = 0\) and \(\nabla_V [A(X)] = (\nabla_V A) (X) + A(\nabla_V X) = (\nabla_V A)(X)\).
</p>

<p>
Therefore from the Riccati equation and the fact that \(\operatorname{R}_V\) is self adjoint,
\[
g((\nabla_V A^{\ast}) (X), Y) = -g(X, \operatorname{R}_V (Y)) - g(X, A^2(Y)) = -g(\operatorname{R}_V (X) + (A^{\ast})^2 (X), Y).
\]
That is, for every \(X, Y\)
\[
g((\nabla_V A^{\ast})(X) + (A^{\ast})^2 (X) + \operatorname{R}_V (X), Y) = 0
\]
and hence
\[
\nabla_V A^{\ast} + (A^{\ast})^2 + \operatorname{R}_V = 0.
\]
</p>

<p>
Therefore the adjoint \(A^{\ast}\) also satisfies the Riccati equation! But if \(A(0)\) is self adjoint, then \(A^{\ast}(0) = A(0)\) and we see that \(A^{\ast}\) satisfies the Riccati equation with the same initial conditions as \(A\). Hence by uniqueness of solutions, \(A^{\ast} = A\) and therefore \(A\) is self adjoint.
</p>

</div>

<div class="rem">
<p>
Ensuring that \(A\) is self adjoint thus amounts to choosing self-adjoint initial conditions \(A(0)\) or equivalently, choosing \(J_i(0), J_i'(0)\), \(1 \leq i \leq n\) such that the mapping \(A_0\) determined by \(A_0(J_i(0)) = J_i'(0)\) is self adjoint. That is,
\[
g(J_i'(0), J_k(0)) = g(A_0(J_i(0)), J_k(0)) = g(J_i(0), A_0(J_k(0))) = g(J_i(0), J_k'(0)).
\]
for each \(1 \leq i,k \leq n\).
