<dt> Reading </dt><dd>  Reading the sections of the textbook corresponding to the assigned homework exercises is considered part of the homework assignment; you are responsible for material in the assigned reading whether or not it is discussed in the lecture.  It will be expected that you read the assigned material in advance of each lecture.
</dd>

<dt> Homework </dt><dd>  There will weekly homework projects, due in the drop-off box in AP&amp;M by 4pm on the due date. I strongly encourage you to discuss the homework with other students in the class and to attend the sections. However, doing the homework exercises <b>and understanding them</b> is your best preparation for the exams. You must write up the solutions yourself and mention any sources used and students with whom you collaborated. See <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/current-students/academics/academic-integrity/index.html">UCSD's policy on Academic Integrity.</a>

<p>
Please observe the following neatness guidelines for homework that you turn in to be graded; homework not conforming to these guidelines will not receive full credit and may not be graded at all.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use clean, white notebook paper that is not torn from a spiral notebook.
</li>
<li>Write your Name, PID, and Section clearly on the front page of your completed assignment.
</li>
<li>Write clearly and legibly.
</li>
<li>Clearly number each solution and present them in numerical order.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt> Exams </dt><dd>  There will be one midterm exams and one final exam. You may bring one 8.5 by 11 inch handwritten sheet of notes - written on both sides - with you to the midterm exam and two sheets - written on both sides - to the final.
