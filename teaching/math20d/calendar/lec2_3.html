<li><a href="#sec-3-1">Existence and Uniqueness, The Wronskian.</a>
  It's worth revisiting this idea. Theorem 3.2.1 tells us that a unique solution to the initial value problem always exists. Theorems 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 suggest a <i>way to find</i> this solution. First, we try to find any two solutions of the differential equation (we're not worried about initial conditions yet). So for the real, distinct root case these are 
  \[
  y_1(t) = e^{r_1 t}, \quad y_2(t) = e^{r_2 t}
  \]
 where \(r_1,r_2\) are the roots which by assumption are real and \(r_1 \ne r_2\). Theorem 3.2.2 now tells us that for any constants \(C_1,C_2\), we can construct the new solution
  \[
  y(t) = C_1 y_1(t) + C_2 y_2(t).
  \]
  Next, Theorem 3.2.3 tells us that if the Wronskian \(W(y_1,y_2) (t_0) \ne 0\), then for any initial conditions \(y_0, y_0'\), <i>the unique solution</i> to the initial value problem can be written as \(y(t) = C_1 y_1(t) + C y_2(t)\). In other words, since we already know \(y\) is a solution to the differential equation, the theorem tells us that we can solve for \(C_1,C_2\) thus satisfying the intial conditions. The uniqueness part of Theorem 3.2.1 means that this is now the solution.
</li>
<li><a href="#Complex-Roots-of-the-Characteristic-Equation">Complex Roots of the Characteristic Equation</a>
  Sometimes the roots of the characteristic equation are complex. In this case, we can construct (by means of Euler's formula) two solutions,
  \begin{align*}
  u_1(t) &= e^{(\lambda + i \mu)t} = e^{\lambda t} (\cos \mu t + i \sin \mu t,\\
  u_2(t) &= e^{(\lambda - i \mu)t} = e^{\lambda t} (\cos \mu t - i \sin \mu t,\\
  \end{align*}
  where the roots are
  \[
  r_1 = \lambda + i \mu, r_2 = \lambda - i \mu
  \]
  which occur in <i>complex conjugate</i> pairs.

<p>
  The problem here is that these solutions are complex valued! By taking the real and imaginary parts of either \(y_1\) or \(y_2\) we can obtain the following real solutions
  \[
  y_1(t) = e^{\lambda t} \cos \mu t, \quad y_2(t) = e^{\lambda t} \sin \mu t.
  \]
  You can check that the Wronskian is not zero for any \(t\) and so we have a <i>fundamental set of solutions</i> \(\{y_1,y_2\}\). That is, the <i>general solution</i> is
  \[
  y(t) = e^{\lambda t} (C_1 \cos \mu t + C_2 \sin \mu t)
  \]
  which means that for any initial conditions \(y_0,y_0'\) we can find \(C_1, C_2\) to satsify the initial conditions.
</p></li>
<li><a href="#sec-3-3">Real, repeated roots of the Characteristic Equation.</a>
  Here the characteristic equation has a repeated root \(r\) and so one solution is given by \(y_1(t) = e^{rt}\) but we don't get a second solution. To find a second solution, use variation of parameters to find a second solution
</li>
</ul>


\[
y_2(t) = t e^{rt}.
\]
<p>
Again, you can check that the Wronskian is non-zero so that \(e^{rt}, te^{rt}\) is a fundamental set of solutions.

<p>The important things to remember here are

<li>a unique solution always exists,
</li>
<li>given solutions of the differential equation \(y_1,y_2\) a linear combination is again a solution,
</li>
<li>if the Wronskian \(W(y_1,y_2)\) is non-zero then the general solution is \(C_1 y_1 + C_2 y_2\) which means we can always solve for any initial conditions. We also say that \(\{y_1,y_2\}\) is a fundamental set of solutions.
