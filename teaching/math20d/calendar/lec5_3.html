  A powerful (pun intended) method of solving differential equations is to use power series substitution. The idea is to suppose we have a solution that is given by a power series, substitute it into the differential equation and see what conditions that imposes on the power series. It turns out that for a broad class of differential equations, we can actually determine the solution as a power series (which means solve for the coefficients). Many functions can be defined in this way, such as the exponential and trigonometric functions. Some functions, such as Bessel's functions, can only be defined in this way.
