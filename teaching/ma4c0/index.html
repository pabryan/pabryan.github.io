  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>This course is about <i>Riemannian geometry</i>, that is the extension of geometry to spaces where differential/integral calculus is possible, namely to manifolds. We will study how to define the notions of length, angle and area on a smooth manifold, which leads to the definition of a <i>Riemannian Manifold</i>. Important concepts are how to differentiate vector fields (connections), how to define the length of a path, and in particular to determine the shortest path between two points (geodesics), how to define the area of a region, and the notion of curvature, in particular the relationship of curvature and geometry. For example, on the sphere (a positively curved surface) the sum of the angles of a (geodesic) triangle is greater than \(\pi\) (Thomas Harriot, 1603; Albert Girard, 1629). At the end of the course, we will touch on some <i>global</i> aspects of Riemannian geometry, and discuss a little about the interaction between curvature, geometry and topology. Such interaction was studied heavily in the mid to late 20'th century and is currently still an active area of research. A famous example is the Hamilton-Perelman resolution of the \poincare conjecture, one of the Clay Foundation's seven Millennium Prizes, was resolved only this century.</p>
