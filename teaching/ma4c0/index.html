  <div class="panel-body">
    <h3>Text Books</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Do Carmo: Riemannian Geometry (a classic text that is certainly relevant today but sometimes considered a little terse)</li>
      <li>Lee: Riemannian Manifolds: An Introduction to Curvature (very readable, possibly a little elementary in places)</li>
      <li>Chavel: Riemannian Geometry: A Modern Introduction (more advanced, extensive discussion of many aspects of Riemannian Geometry)</li>
      <li>Petersen: Riemannian Geometry (more advanced, slightly non-standard approach definitely worth a look at some point)</li>
      <li>Gallot, Hulin, Lafontaine: Riemannian Geometry (more advanced, but very nice development of the formalism of Riemannian Geometry)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lecture Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A students perspective: <a href="https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/vincent/differential_geometry.pdf">Notes taken by Ian Vincent in 2011</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~andrews/DG/">Lectures on Differential Geometry by Ben Andrews</a>(I learned from these notes)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Differentiable Manifolds</h3>
    <p>Some sources for differential manifolds. There are many resources available, and some of the resources listed above treat this topic before moving on to Riemannian Geometry. The following should be sufficient background reading.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lee: Introduction to Smooth Manifolds</li>
      <li>Hitchin: <a href="http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/hitchin/hitchinnotes/Differentiable_manifolds/manifolds2012.pdf">Differentiable Manifolds</a></li>

    <h1 class="panel-title">Course Summary</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>This course is about <i>Riemannian geometry</i>, that is the extension of geometry to spaces where differential/integral calculus is possible, namely to manifolds. We will study how to define the notions of length, angle and area on a smooth manifold, which leads to the definition of a <i>Riemannian Manifold</i>. Important concepts are
      <ul>
	<li>Riemannian metrics</li>
	<li>Connections (differentiation of vector fields)</li>
	<li>Length, angle</li>
	<li>Geodesics (shortest paths)</li>
	<li>Area</li>
	<li>Curvature</li>
      </ul>
    <p>At the end of the course, we will touch on some <i>global</i> aspects of Riemannian geometry, and discuss a little about the interaction between curvature, geometry and topology. Such interaction was studied heavily in the mid to late 20'th century and is currently still an active area of research. A famous example is the Hamilton-Perelman resolution of the Poincar√© conjecture, one of the Clay Foundation's seven Millennium Prizes, was resolved only this century.</p>
