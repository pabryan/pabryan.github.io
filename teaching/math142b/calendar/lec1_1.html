  This is Theorem 6.12 on page 150 of the text. The statement is
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theorem</b>
  Let \(f: [a,b] \to \RR\) be integrable on \([a,b]\) and \(c\in (a,b)\). Then \(f\) is integrable on \([a,c]\) and on \([c,b]\) and the integral is additive over the intervals \([a,c]\) and \([c,b]\) which means that
  \[
  \int_a^b f = \int_a^c f + \int_c^b.
  \]

  To prove this theorem, we took an Archimedean sequence \(\{P_n\}\) for \(f\) on \([a,b]\) which means that \(\lim_{n\to\infty} U(f,P_n) = \lim_{n\to\infty} L(f,P_n)\) and the integral \(\int_a^b f\) is equal to this limit. We then added in the point \(c\) to each \(P_n\) to obtain a new sequence of partitions \(P_n^{\star} = P_n \cup \{c\}\). 
</p>
<p>
  By the refinement lemma, this new sequence is also Archimedean. That is if \(P_n^{\star}\) is a refinement of \(P_n\), then \(U_n^{\star} \leq U_n\) and \(L_n^{\star} \geq L_n\). Therefore
  \[
  0 \leq U_n^{\star} - L_n^{\star} \leq U_n - L_n
  \]
  and the <a href="http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Squeeze_Theorem/Sequences/Real_Numbers">Squeeze Theorem</a> implies \(U_n^{\star} - L_n^{\star} \to 0\) as \(n\to\infty\).
</p>
<p>
  Then we just split the partition \(P_n^{\star}\) into \(P_n' = P_n^{\star} \cap [a,c]\) (the points in \(P_n^{\star}\) contained in \([a,c]\)) and \(P_n'' = P_n^{\star} \cap [c,b]\) (the points in \(P_n^{\star}\) contained in \([c,b]\)). Since \(P_n^{\star}\) contains \(c\), \(P_n'\) is a sequence of partitions of \([a,c]\) and \(P_n''\) is a sequence of partitions of \([c,b]\) (which is why we needed to add in \(c\)). The result follows now from
  \[
  U_n^{\star} - L_n^{\star} = (U_n' - L_n') + (U_n'' - L_n'')
  \]
  and the facts that the left hand side converges to \(0\) as \(n \to \infty\) and the terms in parentheses are non-negative real numbers, hence they also converge to \(0\).
</p>
<p>
  To see this last claim, suppose \(a_n\), \(b_n\) are sequences of non-negative, real numbers such that 
  \[
  \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n + b_n) = 0.
  \]
  To prove this last claim, we can apply the squeeze theorem to
  \[
  0 \leq a_n \leq a_n + b_n
  \]
  which follows since \(a_n,b_n \geq 0\) for every \(n\).

<p>
  This theorem 6.13 from the text which states,
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theorem</b>
  If \(f,g: [a,b] \to \RR\) are integrable and \(f(x) \leq g(x)\) for each \(x\in [a,b]\), then
  \[
  \int_a^b f \leq \int_a^b g.
  \]

  To prove this theorem, we took any partition \(P\) and immediately observed that \(M_i(f) \leq M_i(g)\) for each \(i\). Thus
  \[
  U(f, P) \leq U(g, P)
  \]
  for any partition \(P\). Taking infimum's completes the proof since the infimum over all paritions is the upper integral which is equal to the integral since \(f,g\) are integrable. 
</p>
<p>
  I mentioned that, we need to be a little careful. It is not true (in general) for instance that \(U(f,P)\) is a lower bound for the set of all uppers sums \(\{U(g,P)\}\). There could be partitions \(P_1,P_2\) with \(U(f,P_1) &gt; U(g,P_2)\). For example, take \(f=g\) and \(P_1,P_2\) partitions with different upper sums. Howerver, for any \(\epsilon&gt;0\), by definition of the infimum, there is a partition \(P^{\star}\) such that 
  \[
  U(g,P^{\star}) - \epsilon < \inf\{U(g,P)\} = \int g.
  \]
  Thus
  \[
  \begin{split}
  \int f - \epsilon &= \inf\{U(f,P)\} - \epsilon \leq U(f, P^{\star}) - \epsilon \\
  &\leq U(g, P^{\star}) - \epsilon < \int g.
  \end{split}
  \]
  Since this is true for every \(\epsilon&gt;0\), we must have \(\int f \leq \int g\) as desired.
</p>
<p>
  An alternative proof using Archimedian sequences for \(f,g\) is presented in the text.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">


<p>
  This is Theorem 6.15 in the text, which reads,
</p>
<p>
  <b>Theorem</b>
  Let \(f,g: [a,b] \to \RR\) be integrable and \(\alpha,\beta \in \RR\) be real numbers. Then \(\alpha f + \beta g\) is integrable and
  \[
  \int(\alpha f + \beta g) = \alpha \int f + \beta \int g.
  \]

  I remarked that it is sufficient to prove
</p>
<ol>
<li>\(\int \alpha f = \alpha \int f\)
</li>
<li>\(\int (f + g) = \int f + \int g\)
</li>
</ol>


<p>
  If this is true, then
  \[
  \begin{split}
  \int (\alpha f + \beta g) &= \int \alpha f + \int \beta g \quad \text{(by 1)} \\
  &= \alpha \int f + \beta \int g \quad \text{(by 2)}.
  \end{split}
  \]

  We proved 1 in class. The main subtlety to be aware of here is that if \(\alpha &lt; 0\), then \(m_i(\alpha f) = \alpha M_i(f)\) and \(M_i(\alpha f) = \alpha m_i(f)\). Otherwise, the rest is straight forward. We ran out of time to prove 2 so let's do it here.
</p>
<p>
  We use that
  \[
  M_i(f + g) \leq M_i(f) + M_i(g), \quad m_i(f + g) \geq m_i(f) + m_i(g).
  \]
</p>
<p>  
  This follows for instance by noting that \(f(x) \leq M_i(f)\) and \(g(x) \leq M_i(g)\) for all \(x\in[x_{i-1}, x_i]\) so that
  \[
  f(x) + g(x) \leq M_i(f) + M_i(g).
  \]
  Now take the supremum on the left hand side. Notice that in general we don't get equality. For example, take \(f(x) = x\), \(g(x) = 1-2x\) for \(x\in [0,1]\). So \((f+g)(x) = 1-x\) which has maximum \(M(f+g)=1\) and minimum \(m(f+g)=0\). However, \(f\) has maximum \(M(f)=1\) and minimum \(m(f)=0\) while \(g\) has maximum \(M(g)=1\) and minimum \(m(g)=-1\).
</p>
<p>
  So we may conclude that for any partition \(P\),
  \[
  U(f+g,P) \leq U(f,P) + U(g,P), \quad L(f+g) \geq L(f,P) + L(g,P)
  \]
  which is equation (6.30) in the text (note there is a typo in the text!).
</p>
<p>
  Now, by refinement and the Archimedes-Riemann theorem, there is a sequence \(\{P_n\}\) that is Archimedean sequence for both \(f\) and \(g\). Applying the inequality (6.30) just obtained for each \(n\) gives
  \[
  L(f,P_n) + L(g,P_n) \leq L(f+g,P_n) \leq U(f+g,P_n) \leq U(f,P_n) + U(g,P_n)
  \]
  The far left and far right hand sides both have limit \(\int f + \int g\) as \(n\to \infty\) since \(f\) and \(g\) are integrable and \(\{P_n\}\) is Archimedean for both \(f\) and \(g\). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem the two inner sequences have the same limit which proves both that \(\{P_n\}\) is Archimedian for \(f\) and \(g\) and that \(\int f+g = \int f + \int g\).
