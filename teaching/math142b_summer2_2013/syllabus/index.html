<dt>Reading</dt><dd>
<p>
  Reading the sections of the textbook corresponding to the assigned homework exercises is considered part of the homework assignment; you are responsible for material in the assigned reading whether or not it is discussed in the lecture.  It will be expected that you read the assigned material in advance of each lecture.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Homework</dt><dd>
<p>
  There will be regular homework exercises, due in the drop-off box in AP&amp;M by 5pm on the due date. I strongly encourage you to discuss the homework with other students in the class and to attend the sections. You must write up the solutions yourself and mention any sources used and students with whom you collaborated. See <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/current-students/academics/academic-integrity/index.html">UCSD's policy on Academic Integrity.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Please observe the following neatness guidelines for homework that you turn in to be graded; homework not conforming to these guidelines will not receive full credit and may not be graded at all.
</p><ul>
<li>Use clean, white notebook paper that is not torn from a spiral notebook.
</li>
<li>Write your Name, PID, and Section clearly on the front page of your completed assignment.
</li>
<li>Write clearly and legibly.
</li>
<li>Clearly number each solution and present them in numerical order.

</li>
</ul>
